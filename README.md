# Data Analysis with Python to investigate a claim about blue cars

 # PROJECT DESCRIPTION

 In this project, we have been tasked to understand electric car usage by solving for another research question. We will work as a Data Scientist for the Autolib electric car-sharing service company to investigate a claim about the blue cars from the provided Autolib dataset.

In an effort to do this, we need to identify some areas and periods of interest via sampling stating the reason to the choice of method, then perform hypothesis testing with regards to the claim that we will have made. An example of claim to test would be "Is the number of Bluecars taken in area X different than in area Y? Is it greater in area X than in area Z? Etc‚Äù. The selected periods of interest be either weekdays or weekends but not a mix of both. You can also consider postal codes 75015 vs 75017 to some of the areas of interest.

To work on this project, we will perform the following analysis with Python;

Find and deal with outliers, anomalies, and missing data within the dataset.

Plot appropriate univariate and bivariate summaries recording our observations.

Implement the solution by performing hypothesis testing






# Problem Definition

_Hypothesis Testing Procedure_

I'll present the details concerning how I will test my hypothesis.I'll describe the logic behind my null and alternate hypotheses -- where did they come from, why are they interesting.I'll describe the test statistic  I will  use (i.e., z, t, f) and why? I'll explain the choice of the test statistic, I will discuss whether I  have satisfied the assumptions necessary for using the specific statistic (e.g., does the statistic require your population to be normal and is it?).

*Defining the metric for success*

The objective of this project is to investigate the claim listed above and know whether or not the the average number of blue cars taken is different that of the blue cars returned
